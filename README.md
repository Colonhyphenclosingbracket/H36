A little program for a little Hackathon that took away sleep.

INTRODUCTION:
  This is a website for a fictional company - Ester - that provides educational opportunities for those who don't have those.
  It is part of VinUniversity's business hackathon that took away sleeping time and a bit of hygiene (imagine no shower for 2 days).
  The idea is: the company will provide technological education for people, with a very low price (200000VND) for a full course!
  It's a cheap one, and that's intentional (of course is, but okay).

ESTER:
  Ester is not a name derived from chemistry interest, no no. It's more to the side of a pun, where some (actually a lot of) transformation will turn the Vietnamese version of this into something that actually means what this company does.

THE TEAM:
  The team that developed this program is a team of five, and in honor of all the effort, this program will be here for others to see. Thanks to the other members of the team for having spent so much time (so much, like, really!) on this project, and their contributions that brought new issues that refine the model.

THE CODE:
  This is not AI code (totally, trust!). This is coded as a little tangential challenge within the hackathon: coding an almost fully-functioning website within 4 hours, and this is the result.

THE CONCLUSION:
  Sadly this code did not make its way to the main presentation, but it was a really great challenge.
  In 4 hours this is a real feat, but it is just HTML and CSS, and little functioning JS.
  Indignance exists, but it has to be suppressed.
  For this is a team.

THAT'S IT, ENJOY THE LITTLE JOURNEY THROUGH MY LITTLE CODE SAMPLE.
